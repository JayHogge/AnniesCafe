 What does flesh out mean??
-  Color pallete selected and splotched out throughout the website
-  Pulled major portions of dialogue from old site (copy descriptions of food etc.)
-  Show more tell less (write out comments in the html code describing and translating the blocks of text, acting as placeholders for desired footage/pictures of food)

- Noteworthy components for composition / focused inspiration
-  + Each section has a new background color, marin value, and padding value
 

Our 2 main goals:
